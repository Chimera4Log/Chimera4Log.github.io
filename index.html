            <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: break-word; width: 100%;"><code>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. We will incorporate your guidance into the revision version. We apologize for any confusion that may have arisen due to our presentation. Here is our clarification.

                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Q1: Dataset Selection</em>   </h3>

                    <p>
                        <b>1. Representativeness.</b> BGL and Thunderbird are large-scale and widely-used datasets; numerous recent methods <a href="#ref1">[1]</a><a href="#ref1">[2]</a><a href="#ref1">[3]</a> have been evaluated on them, making the evaluation sufficiently representative.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>2. Quality.</b> The historical faults in the Spirit are repetitive and easily predicted, which is not conducive to a comprehensive evaluation of the methods. In our evaluation of Spirit, we found that faults within it are easily predicted and located with an accuracy exceeding 99% <a href="#ref1">[4]</a>, and such simple fault patterns cannot reflect the challenges faced by real-world systems.
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">

                      <div style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5em;">The evaluation results of the proposed Chimera method on the Spirit dataset. The recurrence of historical faults in the Spirit system makes them highly predictable. Such a simplistic fault model fails to capture the challenges faced by real-world software systems, thus being unsuitable for comprehensively evaluating the proposed method, even though the proposed method effectively handles Spirit's system faults.</div>

                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Q2: Comparison with Pre-trained Methods</em>   </h3>

                    <h3 class="title is-6"> 1. The advantages of multi-task learning   </h3>

                    <p>
                      <span style="padding-left:2em;">
                          <b>1. Fully leveraging the interaction between the two subtasks.</b> The pre-training methods neglect the interaction between the two tasks and cannot bridge the gap between anomaly detection and root cause localization. In this paper, we leverage this interaction through a multi-task learning framework, and evaluations demonstrate that exploiting these interactions indeed achieves effective fault diagnosis.
                      </span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <span style="padding-left:2em;">
                          <b>2. Deployability.</b> Pre-training-based methods require large-scale pre-training on logs and rely on fine-tuning with training data from downstream tasks. These high training costs and data demands are often prohibitive, limiting their deployability. In contrast, the proposed method can be deployed with lower costs.
                      </span>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                      <span style="padding-left:2em;">
                          <b>3. Efficient diagnosis speed.</b> These pre-training-based methods all use multi-layer Transformers as their architecture—for instance, PreLog's checkpoint exceeds 500MB—which results in slow diagnosis speeds, making them difficult to use in real production environments. Chimera uses a lightweight GRU as its architecture, which achieves nearly the fastest efficiency.
                      </span>
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                      <img src="/static/image/efficiency.png" alt="overall" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">
                      <div style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5em;">Chimera utilizes a lightweight structure as its network backbone and employs a multi-instance learning paradigm to predict root cause scores through batch processing of log entries, resulting in faster diagnostic speeds. </div>
                    </div>
                      
                      
                      
                    <h3 class="title is-6"> 2. Pre-trained Methods as Baselines   </h3>

                    
                    <p>
                      <span style="padding-left:2em;">
                          <b>1. High deployment costs.</b> Our objective is to develop a fault diagnosis method for real production environments with strict requirements for diagnosis speed. Considering the high deployment costs of pre-training methods, we did not select them as baselines.
                      </span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <span style="padding-left:2em;">
                          <b>2. Unfair comparison.</b> A significant portion of the performance of pre-training methods stems from large-scale pre-training, which constitutes an unfair comparison for methods trained on a single source.
                      </span>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                      <span style="padding-left:2em;">
                          <b>3. Potential data leakage.</b> We noted that PreLog's pre-training dataset includes our testsets, BGL and Thunderbird, which could lead to potential data leakage and thus result in an unfair comparison.
                      </span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For these reasons, we did not conduct a comparison with pre-training methods.
                    </p>
                      










                    <h3 class="title is-4" id="reviewB">  <span style="color: #bd3e0bf8">To Review #383B</span></h3>
                    

                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Q1: Tools Selection</em>   </h3>

                    <p>
                        <b>1. Baseline Selection.</b> Our selection criterion is to choose the most state-of-the-art and widely evaluated methods as baselines. The four methods we selected are widely used as baselines for evaluation in recent papers <a href="#ref1">[1]</a><a href="#ref1">[2]</a><a href="#ref1">[3]</a></a><a href="#ref1">[4]</a>, which demonstrates that these methods are leading to some extent, making their selection reasonable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>2. Parsing Method.</b> We selected Drain as the parsing tool to maintain a consistent setting with the baseline methods, thereby ensuring the fairness of the evaluation.
                    </p>





                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Q2: Research Findings</em>   </h3>
                    <p>
                      Beyond evaluating the effectiveness, our study yields the following findings:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>1. The confirmation of two critical problems in fault diagnosis.</b> We confirmed two critical issues in existing fault diagnosis: diagnostic bias and suboptimal diagnosis. These two problems cause existing methods to perform poorly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>2. The shortcomings of existing methods.</b> We found that existing methods conduct anomaly detection and root cause localization independently, failing to bridge the gap between the two and thus being unable to address these problems.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                      <b>3. A feasible method for addressing these problems.</b> Our evaluations show that by leveraging the bidirectional interaction between anomaly detection and root cause localization, it is possible to effectively bridge their gap, thereby solving these two problems and improving the performance.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                      We believe our research offers valuable insights to the community and that our findings are worth sharing.
                    </p>
                    


                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Comment 1: Datasets Details</em>   </h3>
                    <p>
                      To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted extensive evaluations on two widely adopted public datasets, BGL and Thunderbird, and on System A – a dataset collected from a Kubernetes-based industrial cloud platform of a major cloud service provider.
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">

                    </div>
                    

                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Comment 2: Hyper-parameter Lambda Selection</em>   </h3>
                    <p>
                      Following the setup of existing work </a><a href="#ref1">[5]</a>, we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets in a 6:3:1 ratio, and determined the optimal lambda on the validation set.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Comment 3: Threats to Validity</em>   </h3>
                    <p>
                      We identify two main threats to the validity of our study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>1. Dataset Selection.</b> In this work, we primarily use the public benchmarks BGL and Thunderbird for evaluation, as both are large-scale, representative, and widely adopted by previous studies </a><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></a><a href="#ref1">[2]</a></a><a href="#ref1">[3]</a>. Reliance on these specific datasets might introduce potential biases into our findings and experimental results. However, the key insights utilized in our study, such as the interactive relationship between the anomaly detection and root cause localization phases, are generalizable across different systems. Therefore, we believe our proposed method and evaluation results remain valid and robust. In the future, we plan to evaluate Chimera's performance on a broader range of system benchmarks.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                      <b>2. Implementation.</b> To mitigate threats related to implementation, our evaluations strictly follow the implementations and configurations from the original publications. For baselines lacking an official implementation, we adopted a third-party version </a><a href="#ref1">[6]</a> that is both peer-reviewed and widely accepted. Furthermore, our proposed method and all baseline approaches were subjected to a stringent peer review of their code. To alleviate threats concerning parameter tuning, we partitioned a validation set to configure the relevant hyperparameters, after which the best-performing configuration was chosen for the final evaluation.
                    </p>





                    <h3 class="title is-4" id="reviewC">  <span style="color: #bd3e0bf8">To Review #383C</span></h3>
                    

                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Q1: Validation Set Usage</em>   </h3>

                    <p>
                        <b>1. Hyperparameter Selection.</b> Following the setup of existing work </a><a href="#ref1">[5]</a>, we partition the dataset into training, validation, and test sets at a 6:3:1 ratio; the validation set is used to select the optimal hyperparameters, and these settings are subsequently evaluated on the test set.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>2. Checkpoint Selection.</b> The validation set is also used to select the best checkpoint during the training process to prevent overfitting.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Q2: Setting of NeuralLog</em>   </h3>

                    <p>
                      We apologize for the misunderstanding and wish to clarify the experimental setup for NeuralLog. In our evaluation experiments, we followed the original settings of all baseline models to ensure the fairness of the evaluation. For NeuralLog, we did not use Drain for log parsing as we did for the other methods; we sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding caused by this lack of clarity and will provide further clarification in the revised version.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="title is-5"> <em>Comment: Training Epochs</em>   </h3>

                    <p>
                      In the provided code, the purpose of setting the maximum epochs to 150 is to ensure sufficient training for the model to converge and achieve optimal performance in a real production environment. However, we have implemented an early stopping strategy that terminates the training once convergence is achieved, so the full 150 epochs are generally not run. In fact, the training typically terminates around 20 epochs. For the evaluation, we follow the settings of prior work </a><a href="#ref1">[5]</a> and set the training to 20 epochs for all methods to ensure a fair comparison.
                    </p>

            <b>Issues: <b><span style="color: #228be6">Diagnostic Bias</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #228be6">Suboptimal Diagnosis</span></b> in Log-based Software System Fault Diagnosis</b><br>
            Log-based fault diagnosis are divided into two stages: 1. anomaly detection is performed first, and 2. if a fault is detected, further root cause localization is conducted.
            <ul>
              <li>
                  Diagnostic Bias: If the detector yields inaccurate results, these inaccuracies will also be passed on to the localizer.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Suboptimal Diagnosis: A system fault may not be simultaneously detected and localized.

            <b>Key technologies: Bridging the gap between anomaly detection and root cause localization through their <b><span style="color: #228be6">Bidirectional Interaction</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #228be6">Knowledge Transfer</span></b> </b><br>
            In our view, the root cause of these issues is that anomaly detection and root cause localization rely on different forms of data for training and have distinct diagnostic objectives for faults. The anomaly detection uses anomalous log sequences as training data, with the diagnostic objective of determining whether a fault has occurred in the system. The root cause localization utilizes root cause logs as training data, with the objective of localizing the fault that caused the failure. Simply piecing together expert models to construct a fault diagnosis system cannot effectively bridge the gap between the two in terms of data forms and diagnostic objectives, nor can it handle fault diagnosis within a unified framework.

            <b>Our propose method: <b><span style="color: #228be6">Chimera</span></b> </b><br>
            Addressing these issues requires bridging the gap between the two sub-tasks in terms of data forms and diagnostic objectives, and constructing an end-to-end fault diagnosis system. Our approach is to implement interactive multi-task learning between the two sub-tasks. Our key insight is that there is a strong mutual implication between the anomaly detection task and the root cause localization task, and their bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer can bridge the gaps in data forms and diagnostic objectives.

          Two different fault diagnosis deployment paradigms. The existing log-based fault diagnosis method is deployed in a task-independent paradigm. Initially, the labeled log sequences and log entries are inputted, and the detector and localizer are trained independently. Finally, the two are integrated into a fault diagnosis network, leading to issues such as diagnostic bias accumulates. The proposed log-based fault diagnosis method is deployed in an task-interactive paradigm. The labeled log sequence is used to train the detector and localizer interactively in an end-to-end manner, resulting in excellent diagnostic performance.

                  Existing log-based fault diagnosis methods conduct anomaly detection and root cause localization in a task-independent manner, which fails to adequately address the inevitable diagnostic bias in fault diagnosis, thereby severely impacting diagnostic performance.

                  Existing fault diagnosis methods independently perform anomaly detection and root cause localization, neglecting their collaborative relationship, which prevents simultaneous detection and localization of faults, resulting in a large number of undesirable suboptimal diagnoses.

            The proposed end-to-end log-based fault diagnosis pipeline for Chimera. Chimera pipeline comprises three key stages: Log Preprocessing, Interactive Log Representation Learning (ILRL), and Joint Fault Diagnosis. Firstly, the raw system logs are labeled and parsed into log event sequences, and corresponding log embeddings are extracted. Secondly, the ILRL module to learns shared and private representations for anomaly detection and root cause localization interactively, and combines them into a log representation for fault diagnosis. Finally, the learned log representation is fed into the localizer and detector for joint fault diagnosis. Chimera bridges the gap between anomaly detection and root cause localization through their bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer, achieving more effective end-to-end fault diagnosis.

            The workflow of Sequence-driven Localizer. Given embeddings of log sequence, the network outputs a score for each log and locates the root cause log. The localizer is designed based on the principle of multi-instance learning, and locates the root cause log by comparing the scores of normal log sequences and anomalous log sequences.
