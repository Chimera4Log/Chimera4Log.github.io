            <b>Issues: <b><span style="color: #228be6">Diagnostic Bias</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #228be6">Suboptimal Diagnosis</span></b> in Log-based Software System Fault Diagnosis</b><br>
            Log-based fault diagnosis are divided into two stages: 1. anomaly detection is performed first, and 2. if a fault is detected, further root cause localization is conducted.
            <ul>
              <li>
                  Diagnostic Bias: If the detector yields inaccurate results, these inaccuracies will also be passed on to the localizer.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Suboptimal Diagnosis: A system fault may not be simultaneously detected and localized.

            In our view, the root cause of these issues is that anomaly detection and root cause localization rely on different forms of data for training and have distinct diagnostic objectives for faults. The anomaly detection uses anomalous log sequences as training data, with the diagnostic objective of determining whether a fault has occurred in the system. The root cause localization utilizes root cause logs as training data, with the objective of localizing the fault that caused the failure. Simply piecing together expert models to construct a fault diagnosis system cannot effectively bridge the gap between the two in terms of data forms and diagnostic objectives, nor can it handle fault diagnosis within a unified framework. 
         </p>

         <p>
            <b>Our propose method: <b><span style="color: #228be6">Chimera</span></b> </b><br>
            Addressing these issues requires bridging the gap between the two sub-tasks in terms of data forms and diagnostic objectives, and constructing an end-to-end fault diagnosis system. Our approach is to implement interactive multi-task learning between the two sub-tasks. Our key insight is that there is a strong mutual implication between the anomaly detection task and the root cause localization task, and their bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer can bridge the gaps in data forms and diagnostic objectives.

          Two different fault diagnosis deployment paradigms. The existing log-based fault diagnosis method is deployed in a task-independent paradigm. Initially, the labeled log sequences and log entries are inputted, and the detector and localizer are trained independently. Finally, the two are integrated into a fault diagnosis network, leading to issues such as diagnostic bias accumulates. The proposed log-based fault diagnosis method is deployed in an task-interactive paradigm. The labeled log sequence is used to train the detector and localizer interactively in an end-to-end manner, resulting in excellent diagnostic performance.

                  Existing log-based fault diagnosis methods conduct anomaly detection and root cause localization in a task-independent manner, which fails to adequately address the inevitable diagnostic bias in fault diagnosis, thereby severely impacting diagnostic performance.

                  Existing fault diagnosis methods independently perform anomaly detection and root cause localization, neglecting their collaborative relationship, which prevents simultaneous detection and localization of faults, resulting in a large number of undesirable suboptimal diagnoses.

            The proposed end-to-end log-based fault diagnosis pipeline for Chimera. Chimera pipeline comprises three key stages: Log Preprocessing, Interactive Log Representation Learning (ILRL), and Joint Fault Diagnosis. Firstly, the raw system logs are labeled and parsed into log event sequences, and corresponding log embeddings are extracted. Secondly, the ILRL module to learns shared and private representations for anomaly detection and root cause localization interactively, and combines them into a log representation for fault diagnosis. Finally, the learned log representation is fed into the localizer and detector for joint fault diagnosis. Chimera bridges the gap between anomaly detection and root cause localization through their bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer, achieving more effective end-to-end fault diagnosis.
